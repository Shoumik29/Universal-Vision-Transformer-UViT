Here I have programmed the original [UViT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09747) model in tensorflow

As i have not found any provided code in the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09747)

I have also provided the data process program to feed the [CIHP](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/awsaf49/coco-2017-dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12596) dataset to the model

I can not provide the dataset into github for obvious reason
