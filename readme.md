Here I have programmed the original [UViT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09747) model in tensorflow

As i have not found any provided code in the original [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.09747)

I have also provided the data process program to feed the [CIHP](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12596) dataset and [COCO2017](https://cocodataset.org/#home) dataset to the model

I can not provide the dataset into github for obvious reason
